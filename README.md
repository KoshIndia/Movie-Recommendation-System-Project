# Movie-Recommendation-System-Project

Minor project developed as a part of the specilization in Data Analytics under the IBM Innovation Centre for Education, SVKM’s NMIMS University, Mumbai.

**About**

Predicting a movie’s opening success is a difficult problem, since it does 
not always depend on its quality only. External factors such as competing 
movies, time of the year and even weather influence the success as these 
factors impact the BoxOffice sales for the moving opening. Nevertheless, 
predicting a movie’s opening success in terms of BoxOffice ticket sales is 
essential for a movie studio, in order to plan its cost and make the work 
profitable. We introduce a simple solution for predicting movie success in 
terms of financial success and viewer recipients. As a result, this approach 
achieved decent estimations, allowing theatre planning to a certain extent, 
even for small studios. So, the prediction of movie success is of great 
importance to the industry. Machine learning algorithms are widely used to 
make predictions such as growth in the stock market, demand for products,
etc. This paper presents a detailed study of Adaboost, SVM Logistic 
Regression, Naïve Bayes Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbours on 
IMDbdata to predict movie box office.
Thousands of films are released every year. Since the 1920s, the film 
industry has grossed more money every year than that of any other country. 
Cinema is a multi-billion-dollar industry where even individual films earn 
over a billion dollars. Large production houses control most of the film 
industry, with billions of dollars spent on advertisements alone. Advertising 
campaigns contribute heavily to the total budget of the movies. Sometimes 
the investment results in heavy losses to the producers. Warner Brothers, 
one of the largest production houses, had a fall in their revenues last year,
despite the inflation and the increased number of movies released. If it was 
somehow possible to know beforehand the likelihood of success of the 
movies, the production houses could adjust the release of their movies to 
gain maximum profit. They could use the predictions to know when the 
market is dull and when it is not. This shows a dire need for such software 
to be developed. Many have tried to accomplish this goal of predicting 
movie revenues. Techniques such as social media sentiment analysis have 
been used in the past. None of the studies thus far have succeeded in 
suggesting.
While the development of this project, we have opted Python as the 
programming language. Python libraries that will be used for the 
development of this program are:
Numpy, Pandas, Scikit Learn, Seaborn and Random. For the exploratory 
analysis of the data, we have used Tableau and Python.
We have used Visual Studio as the integrated development environment 
for the program. Reason for using Visual Studio Code is because its code 
extensions cover more than just programming language capabilities:
• Keymaps allow users already familiar with Atom, Sublime Text, Emacs, 
Vim, PyCharm, or other environments to feel at home.
• Themes customize the UI whether you like coding in the light, dark, or 
something more colourful.
• Language packs provide a localized experience.
We used Tableau for EDA as EDA is the step that is performed before doing 
the machine learning models and it provides valuable insights on the current 
state of the data. It may throw light on the code errors in the Data pipeline 
which resulted in the data and also helps in visualizing the outliers in your 
data.
There are many ways to perform EDA, the most common way is using 
libraries such as matplotlib, Seaborn etc. We prefer to use Tableau to 
perform EDA and then if required use the libraries to get any visualizations 
which are not available as part of the software.
